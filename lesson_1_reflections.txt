How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By displaying only the differences beteween the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By fixing possible mistakes faster and learning from them as a reflection between the two versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Comment & tag the actual change
    Cons: Spend some time in saving the file for each change created.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is a version control system of the entire project, hence we need a timestamp for the hole project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I don't remember.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always restore the previous version of the project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To create a simple project and use it with gitHub.
