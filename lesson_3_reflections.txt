When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on multiple PC's or colaborating with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because when it comes to conflicts, the user should take action.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is online copy within github, clone is a copy into local mashine. One uses clone to copy localy,
    also multiple times. Forking is only used for online repositories that are not your own.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    There would occur less conflicts, and one needs to make less merges.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use bitbucket.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
